Led team of developers to increase test coverage by more than 300% reducing regression time from 3 days to 10 minutes
Developed a testing framework at ANGI using Behavioural-driven model for plain-language test case development that improved the speed and coverage of regression testing. Trained QA engineers on my testing framework, and spoke in front of a group of ~80 software engineers for adaptation and usage.

Strengths
======
Creative Problem Solving
Repeatedly recognized for novel approaches to tricky problems.

Keep it DRY
DRY and Do it right the first time. Although a proof-of-concept can involve the coding equivalent to “shooting from the hip,” it’s common for a business owner or CIO to see a working concept and say, “Let’s just use that.” One difference between a developer and a senior engineer is understanding where code is likely to end up in production, and knowing the balance of getting a POC done quickly while still maintaining codebase integrity. If it shouldn’t be in production, it shouldn’t be in a POC. Even a concept should be testable.

Proof-of-Concept Success
Multiple greenfield projects and POCs adapted to production in every role since 2009.

Communication
Charismatic, positive and patient. Able to communicate complex technology and processes to non-technical audiences. Able to accept constructive criticism without negative responses.

Documentation and writing
Acknowledged accomplishments in creating clear documentation for end users as well as development notes and code reviews.
