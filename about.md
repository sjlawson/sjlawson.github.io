## Ae coder's profile


The stack that I've seen the most of is Linux, MySQL, ElasticSearch, Python (Flask or Django) supporting an API for a frontend JS framework like React,
Vue or Angular on Node servers.  


I've used a lot of different programming languages, frameworks, and server applications
over more than 15 years in FT software development. What I enjoy most is building solutions
to big data questions - the kind of questions that come up in science, energy, education,
business intelligence or almost any field where massive piles of information can get
overwhelming if not for the set of specialised skills I've learned to use to make the mountain
manageable.
