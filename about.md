## Ae Fond k8s and then we server!
(look up Robert Burns' "Ae Fond Kiss")


I've worked with all kinds of different languages, libraries, and tools, but a stack I find to be highly versatile consists of Linux, MySQL, ElasticSearch, Python (Flask or Django) supporting an API for a frontend JS framework like NextJS or React on Node servers.

In addition to that, AWS Lambda with S3, Glue, and RDS can accoplish a lot of ETL tasks in short order.


I've built enterprise scale applications using a variety of programming languages, frameworks, and platforms over more than 15 years in FT software development. What I enjoy most is building solutions to big data questions - the kind of questions that come up in science, energy, education, business intelligence or almost any field where massive piles of information can get overwhelming if not for the set of specialised skills I've learned to use to make the mountain manageable.
