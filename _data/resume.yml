  summary: >
      Leading and contributing to development of backend and serverless enterprise data-focused
      applications. I also have extra experience in commodity market data as a founding full stack data
      and application engineer, as well as life science and business data from US-gov clinical trials, IEEE
      publications meta data, and S&P Business data.
      I have over 20 years programming experience with the last 15 years in full-time software engineering roles
      using 18 programming languages. My background in technology allows me to learn new
      languages quickly, while my background in education, history, and the arts is valuable for creative
      thinking - solving problems for which a best-fit solution is less apparent.
      An example of an application stack in which I have senior experience is Python, Flask or
      Django, PySpark, MySQL, ElasticSearch, React, Typescript.  <br>
      If you're interested in something within my skill-set, or would like to discuss something tech. related then, feel free to reach out.<br><br>
      I'd love to talk.<br><br>
