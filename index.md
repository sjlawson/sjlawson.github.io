My GitHub repos date back to 2012. If you are looking for a developer, I think you'll find the following projects the most relevant rather than just poking around the ancient burial mounds of code.

- This is a proof-of-concept project with Python, Flask, and PySpark for data ingestion, storage, analysis (just some simple aggregations), and API for a weather dataset.
  - Can be deployed locally with a single `docker-compose up` command. 
  - [Weather Data API](https://github.com/sjlawson/weatherdata-pyspark-api)
- Movie-Link was my coding challenge for ResoluteAI. There are two parts. The largest involved building a complete backend service with API to be used by the frontend.
  - [Movie Link (Python/Flask backend)](https://github.com/sjlawson/movie-link-backend)
  - [Movie Link (React frontend)](https://github.com/sjlawson/movie-link-frontend)
- This is a data and API project related to musicians, genres, and audiences. Sharing the GitLab repo for commit history 
      - [Music Audience Exchange](https://gitlab.com/sjlawson/maxdata)
