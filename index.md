My GitHub repos date back to 2012, so rather than just poking around I think you'll find the following three projects most relevant.  

    - This project is a dockerised data ingestion, storage, analysis (just some simple aggregations), and API for a weather dataset. It also features local test deployment with a single `docker-compose up` command.  
      - [Weather Data API](https://github.com/sjlawson/weatherdata-code-sample)

    - Movie-Link was my coding challenge for ResoluteAI. There are two parts. The largest involved building a complete backend service with API to be used by the frontend.
      - [Movie Link (backend)(https://github.com/sjlawson/movie-link-backend)
      - [Movie Link (React frontend)](https://github.com/sjlawson/movie-link-frontend)

    - This is a data and API project related to musicians, genres, and audiences. Sharing the GitLab repo for commit history 
      - [Music Audience Exchange](https://gitlab.com/sjlawson/maxdata)
